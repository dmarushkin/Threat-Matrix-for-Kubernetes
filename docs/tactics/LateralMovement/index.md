# Lateral Movement

The lateral movement tactic consists of techniques that are used by attackers to move through the victimâ€™s environment. In containerized environments, this includes gaining access to various resources in the cluster from a given access to one container, gaining access to the underlying node from a container, or gaining access to the cloud environment.
